# Enabling the cloud profile

This sample project demonstrates that the cloud profile does not seem to be enabled properly if the
user specify its own.

Using buildpack 3.3

## No profile enabled

Push this app with no modification at all and you should be able to see this if you hit the root

```
{
cloud: "Hello from the Cloud",
dev: "Dev profile not enabled"
}
```

```

```

NOTE: Note that _Activated profiles cloud_ is not logged because the list of active profiles is empty.

## Enabling a custom profile

Now let's enable a custom profile. We expect the `cloud` profile to be enabled regardless.

Create the following `manifest.yml`

```
---
applications:
- name: test-cf-profile
  env:
    SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: dev
```

The `cloud` profile is _still_ not enabled anymore (according to Boot).

```

```

But the configuration file does not seem to be loaded either:

```
{
cloud: "Cloud profile not enabled",
dev: "Dev profile is enabled"
}
```
